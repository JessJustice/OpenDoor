OpenDoor - chat log 3     (10/23/2015 @ 8pm-10pm)     Aaron, Eli, Jessica, Ethan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
aaroncarson: hi
eli_gas: i have linix installed, and im caught up in the open source hw, and the senior project hw
jessica_: nice
jessica_: your dev enviro is set up?
aaroncarson: Sweet.  Looks like I’m the last one in the meeting
eli_gas: not milestone 2 though, still working on that
aaroncarson: Hey everyone, please go to https://github.com/aaroncarsonart/OpenDoor and follow my instructions on that page
aaroncarson: for how to download my git file.  Just put it wherever you like by running the command I recommended
aaroncarson: I figured it would be a good place to start.  there’s two files there written in markdown we can add to.  One is about git, the other about linux
aaroncarson: If everyone can download it, and figure out how to create a branch and push an update, that would be a swell use of our meeting
eli_gas: thats great man
Ethan_E: coolio
jessica_: K, I'll have to do it later, I'm in windows right now.
eli_gas: me too
Ethan_E: me too 
jessica_: Or I can log off and meet you back here.
aaroncarson: download link you guys
aaroncarson: Git-1.9.5-preview20141217
aaroncarson: sorry
aaroncarson: http://git-scm.com/download/win
aaroncarson: get to work 
aaroncarson: plz
jessica_ left the chat room. (Remote host closed the connection)
eli_gas: ugh, if we must 
jessica_ joined the chat room.
jessica_: warning! If I log off and switch to Linux, I have windows updates that will install. Last night it took over an hour just to shut down properly...
aaroncarson: I have been trying to wrap my head around some git stuff, I can try to coach people through more basics if possible.  We discussed going over this in our meeting anyways
aaroncarson: You can do it either way, Jess.  May as well try it on windows too, though I’m not sure if it is all the same probably is)
Ethan_E: I'm switching to linux rn...
jessica_ left the chat room. (Remote host closed the connection)
Ethan_E: can I just "sudo apt-get git"?
aaroncarson: not on windows
aaroncarson: on Linux, yes
Ethan_E: ubuntu?
Ethan_E: is that it? "git"?
aaroncarson: yes, I jsut did
aaroncarson: on my Mint
aaroncarson: it should be the same
eli_gas: aaron,  can you do the log this week
Ethan_E: it didn't work 
aaroncarson: sudo apt-get install git
Ethan_E: there we go 
Ethan_ joined the chat room.
aaroncarson: all you have to run after you install git is this command where you want to local repository:
aaroncarson: git clone https://github.com/aaroncarsonart/OpenDoor.git
Ethan_: well this is
Ethan_E: awkward...
aaroncarson: 2 logins, strange
Ethan_: 2 comps 
eli_gas: done
aaroncarson: no need to create an enclosing folder either, the clone makes a top-level directory called OpenDoor
aaroncarson: once it’s in there, you can `cd OpenDoor`
aaroncarson: then start a new branch
aaroncarson: do the command `git branch MyNewBranch` or some useful name
aaroncarson: then switch to the branch with git checkout MyNewBranch
aaroncarson: check that you’ve switched with `git branch`
aaroncarson: then add a new file, or edit one of the text files.
aaroncarson: Once you’re happy with your edits, you can save your work to your local branch by doing `git add .` to add new files
aaroncarson: then do `git commit -a -m “A description of your changes”` and your repository is ready to be uploaded
aaroncarson: Let me know if anyone has issues up to that point
Ethan_: how long should it take to make a branch?
aaroncarson: instantaneous, or fast
aaroncarson: there’s 2 text files
jessica joined the chat room.
aaroncarson: Hi jessica
Ethan_: ok, it was because I had an apostrophe in it 
jessica: Hello!
aaroncarson: can you see our previous messages
aaroncarson: or should I repost them
jessica: nope
aaroncarson: ok
aaroncarson: so first, please grab the branch with
eli_gas: im in a branch,
jessica: nope, I can't see them
aaroncarson: git clone https://github.com/aaroncarsonart/OpenDoor.git
aaroncarson: next run: cd OpenDoor
jessica: ok... I'm assuming I need to do something to get git first?
aaroncarson: if you haven’t installed git,
aaroncarson: run: sudo apt-get install git
aaroncarson: what was that, eli?
Ethan_: to git git 
eli_gas: just hanging out in my branch
Ethan_: ya, how do we edit the files?
aaroncarson: have you edited a file, or created a new file in the directory
aaroncarson: ok
aaroncarson: so, you can type: gedit README.md
aaroncarson: and it will open README.md in gedit
aaroncarson: then edit, save, and go back to terminal
Ethan_: so, if I open it in the file editor?
Ethan_: is that ok?
aaroncarson: yeah
aaroncarson: you can use any method you like to edit the file
aaroncarson: you can also use your normal file browser, if you like it
aaroncarson: the gui
aaroncarson: git manages the file system, regardless of how you access it
aaroncarson: you can also be fancy and use one of the methods I recommended in the linuxHelp.md file
aaroncarson: But I’d just play with those later
aaroncarson: let me know when you’re done installing, Jessica
jessica: git is installed
aaroncarson: ok, run the git clone command i posted earlier
aaroncarson: in the directory you want your local repository
aaroncarson: it can go anywhere
aaroncarson: If you don’t know, I might recommend /usr/yourname/code
jessica: local repository as in ~?
aaroncarson: type: cd ~
aaroncarson: then I would do: mkdir code
jessica: k
aaroncarson: cd code
Ethan_: or mkdir git
aaroncarson: yeah
Ethan_: and cd git 
aaroncarson: then do
aaroncarson: it clone https://github.com/aaroncarsonart/OpenDoor.git
jessica: ~/code
aaroncarson: sorry
jessica: :
aaroncarson: git clone https://github.com/aaroncarsonart/OpenDoor.git
jessica: ls
jessica: haha, sorry, wrong box...
aaroncarson: eli: now that you’re probably edited stuff, you need to push the file to github.  But first, I think you all need a github account
aaroncarson: so you have to go to the website, and sign up if you haven’t already
aaroncarson: note your username, email, and password when you do
eli_gas: i did it when i did the tut i thought but its saying not
jessica: I'm at jessica ~/code
aaroncarson: run the command i posted earlier
jessica: there's nothing in it. Is this the local repostitory you talked about
Ethan_: coolio
aaroncarson: the git clone
aaroncarson: then ls
Ethan_: I made a "silly" edit to the README file 
aaroncarson: let’s wait just a second to get on the same page here
aaroncarson: status?
eli_gas: creating git hub account
aaroncarson: gotcha
eli_gas: done
jessica: just a minute...
aaroncarson: if your local edits are done (for eli and ethan), you can run the command: git add .
Ethan_: done
Ethan_: and committed
aaroncarson: ok
Ethan_E left the chat room. (Remote host closed the connection)
aaroncarson: then, you have to set up a remote connection
Ethan_: ?
jessica: oh my gosh.  Anybody know how to fix an iPhone?  My daughter locked herself out
Ethan_:
jessica: Seriously.
aaroncarson: get remote add origin https://github.com/aaroncarsonart/OpenDoor.git
aaroncarson: sorry, git not get
Ethan_: what?
aaroncarson: git remote add origin https://github.com/aaroncarsonart/OpenDoor.git
aaroncarson: run that command
eli_gas: im getting sh.exe not found error when i try to open the file
aaroncarson: hmm, are you working on windows, eli?
Ethan_: "remote origin already exists."
eli_gas: yup
aaroncarson: ok
aaroncarson: well, I had to do it, maybe because I set it up originally
aaroncarson: git push origin <your branch name>
aaroncarson: that command pushes it onto github
aaroncarson: you need to type your username and password
aaroncarson: you may get an error where you need to set your git username and email on your local machine
aaroncarson: if you do, run
aaroncarson: git config —global user.email <your email>
eli_gas: did that
Ethan_: ya I did that
aaroncarson: and then also for username
eli_gas: yup
aaroncarson: did the push work?
Ethan_: hmm
aaroncarson: I’m still not 100% sure how that works
Ethan_: I don't think it's liking my un...
aaroncarson: I may need to create a pull request, I’m trying to learn about stuff
eli_gas: same
eli_gas: we all are
aaroncarson: ok, one second
Ethan_: done
aaroncarson: jessica, are you ready to do something
Ethan_: pushed
jessica: K. I did the clone
Ethan_: create a branch now
Ethan_: git branch "branch name"
Ethan_: (with no quotes xD)
aaroncarson: ethan, yours worked?
Ethan_: ya
jessica: what is the branch name?
Ethan_: make one up
aaroncarson: Ethan, please enter: git remote -v
jessica: fatal not a git repository
aaroncarson: I want to know where you pushed to, I don’t see updates from you on the site
aaroncarson: jessica
aaroncarson: you need to cd into the repository
Ethan_: "origin https://github.com/aaroncarsonart/OpenDoor.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/aaroncarsonart/OpenDoor.git (push)"
aaroncarson: example: cd OpenDoor
aaroncarson: Ethan: that is the same as mine.  hmm.
jessica: I thought that's what I did...
aaroncarson: jessica: pwd
aaroncarson: then: ls
Ethan_: open the README file
Ethan_: I didn't ADD any files... just added to the README
jessica: I'm in jessica ~/code as I stated before, there is nothing here
aaroncarson: over you ran the clone, you have nothing in it
jessica: Wait! Open door is here now
aaroncarson: ok
Ethan_: "git clone https://gith
Ethan_: lol
aaroncarson: ethan, what was your branch name
Ethan_: EthansTestBranch
aaroncarson: Ok, we’re learning here, but I have an idea
aaroncarson: Ethan, please do: git merge EthansTestBranch
aaroncarson: that will merge your changes into master
Ethan_: Already up-to-date.
aaroncarson: then, do: git branch master
jessica: where is the repository? I have linux help and readme
aaroncarson: check that your changes are still there
Ethan_: 'master' already exists
aaroncarson: sorry: git checkout master
aaroncarson: check your changes persisted, then run: git branch -d EthansTestBranch
aaroncarson: jessica:
Ethan_: k
aaroncarson: the repository is OpenDoor.
Ethan_ is now known as Ethan_E.
eli_gas: idk
aaroncarson: if you type: git status
aaroncarson: you will see you are in the master branch
aaroncarson: if you type: ls -l, you will see you have a hidden file, .git
jessica: jessica@jessica-Yoga ~/code/OpenDoor $ git branch "branch one"
jessica: fatal: 'branch one' is not a valid branch name.
jessica: jessica@jessica-Yoga ~/code/OpenDoor $
eli_gas: I am on branch EliGaseous
aaroncarson: it manages everything, but you don’t care about it
aaroncarson: ok.
eli_gas: my working directory is clean and i thnk im trying to pull things into it right?
Ethan_E: my changes were reverted...
aaroncarson: I’m going to create a “pull request” on the website for you guys, and see if I can get it to work
aaroncarson: ethan, switch to the other branch with: git checkout EthansTestBranch
aaroncarson: your changes should still be there.
aaroncarson: then re-run: git add .
aaroncarson: and git commit -a -m”message"
aaroncarson: oh hey
aaroncarson: Apparently, it takes a while to see updates, I got your push, ethan
jessica: now what?
aaroncarson: oh wait, nevermind
aaroncarson: It was what I made
eli_gas: lol
aaroncarson: Ethan, if you figure out your merges, let me know
aaroncarson: ok jessica, edit one of the files, or make a new one
Ethan_E: nothing to commit
aaroncarson: you can use the regular file manager to do it
aaroncarson: or you can do: gedit README.md and make changes
jessica: a file in .git
aaroncarson: ethan: git diff
aaroncarson: or: git diff --cached
aaroncarson: jessica: yes
aaroncarson: this excercise is to see if we can update the files on the github server
Ethan_E: git diff doesn't do anything...
Ethan_E: but the changes came back when I changed branches...
aaroncarson: ethan: are you running it in your master branch, or your separate branch?
Ethan_E: separate
aaroncarson: example, run: git branch
aaroncarson: to see current branch
aaroncarson: ok
aaroncarson: are your changes there?
Ethan_E: ya
Ethan_E: MY branch shows the changes
Ethan_E: but I guess I can't push them to the master?
aaroncarson: ok, let me look in some notes real quick, should have worked
Ethan_E: (I'm going to post some stuff here of my own when I figure it out ^^)
eli_gas: i have the files, i opend them in an editor, im trying to  add?
aaroncarson: eli: the goal is to make changes, don’t delete anything useful, just add a paragraph or some noticable text, then save it.
eli_gas: no i meant on git
aaroncarson: jessica:
eli_gas: i just put my name in the file
aaroncarson: I forgot a step to tell you
jessica: how do I back out of branches?
aaroncarson: please cancel your edit, go back to the terminal
aaroncarson: wait, did you make a new branch>
aaroncarson: ?
eli_gas: omg
eli_gas: yes
aaroncarson: what is wrong, eli
aaroncarson: good or bad omg
eli_gas: both
eli_gas: gimme a sec
aaroncarson: jessica: please type: git branch
aaroncarson: or if you know your branch, tell me what you are in
eli_gas: EliGaseous
jessica: I'm in .git/branches but there's nothing in it
jessica: just . .. when I do ls -a
aaroncarson: ok, so I didn’t realize, I needed to add everyone to my github as collaborators
aaroncarson: please dump your github usernames here
aaroncarson: so I can add you
Ethan_E: netwarior
aaroncarson: I don’t think I’ll see your updates otherwise
eli_gas: lol
eli_gas: EliGaseous
aaroncarson: one r, ethan
jessica: um... that may be part of the problem. I don't recall...
jessica: give me a minute
Ethan_E: (you "lol"ing me?)
aaroncarson: ok, so Idded ethan and eli.
aaroncarson: you are now collaborators.  I created an “issue” for each of you to resolve, which you were assigned to.
aaroncarson: See if you can find it in the website. (this is just exploration here)
aaroncarson: There is also an unassigned issue.
aaroncarson: Ethan and eli: you can try a push again to the site, I may have added changes that let you collaborate with me now
aaroncarson: i mean the terminal comand: git push origin master
Ethan_E: check that
aaroncarson: sorry if posting too much, I feel like we’re getting somewhere
jessica: I need a user name... this a place for a real name, or something spunky?  I want to be easy to network with
Ethan_E: do you see the edit Aaron?
aaroncarson: either way
aaroncarson: hmm, I’m looking around, and I’m not sure.  What did you do, Ethan?
aaroncarson: did you click on “Issues” (which is the (!) icon on the side)
aaroncarson: then click on the issue assigned to you, and try to resolve it?
jessica: JessJustice
aaroncarson: sweet
eli_gas: getting it
aaroncarson: ok, you were added as a collaborator, jessica
aaroncarson: now, please go to the github page https://github.com/aaroncarsonart/OpenDoor/
aaroncarson: and go to “issues"
aaroncarson: and try to close an issue I assigned to you
aaroncarson: ok Ethan, I responded to your message
eli_gas: how do i get out of the commit message console
aaroncarson: are you online, eli
aaroncarson: oh,
aaroncarson: I know what you need
jessica: closed
aaroncarson: you typed commit -a
aaroncarson: but didn’t specify a message
aaroncarson: type a message, then type esc + : + q + enter
aaroncarson: it’s the vim editor, very strange
jessica: um... am I supposed to be doing this in terminal or on the website?
aaroncarson: jess: my command was for the website, no more terminal for now, go to gui
aaroncarson:
aaroncarson: So, ethan: try to push to the site again.
jessica: yay!
aaroncarson: if you have no edits, make a new one in your custom branch
aaroncarson: Looks like you closed your issue, jessica.  cool
eli_gas: vim wasnt letting me go so i closed it
aaroncarson: Eli: can you find the issues on the website and close the issue I passed you?  type some messages too, fi you want
eli_gas: but git closed to
aaroncarson: i’m sorry
aaroncarson: vim is wierd
aaroncarson: I’ve gotten stuck there before too, it’s really strange
jessica: I just wish I used my other email address, this is going to clutter up my inbox fast
aaroncarson: Also: everyone should put their fancy photos from cs 425 on their github page, so we can be all social
aaroncarson: ok, Jess: now taht you closed that issue, please go back to the terminal.  Have you edited one of the files and re-saved it, no matter how insignificant?
Ethan_E: LONGEST IRC CHAT EVAR!!!
Ethan_E is now known as EthanEiter.
aaroncarson: BEST IRC CHAT EVAR
EthanEiter: lol
EthanEiter: we gettin stuff done
aaroncarson: I know
jessica: where?
aaroncarson: in the repository OpenDoor,
aaroncarson: have you opened one of the two files with an editor and added something, then saved it?
jessica: how do I get there on the website?
aaroncarson: no
aaroncarson: sorry
aaroncarson: do it on  your machine now
jessica: k, how do I get to the repository?
aaroncarson: what is your directory
aaroncarson: if you’re in OpenDoor
aaroncarson: you’re in the repository
jessica: blahblahblah... .git/branches
aaroncarson: no
aaroncarson: sorry
aaroncarson: you need to: cd ..
aaroncarson: twice
jessica: OpenDoor/.git/branches
aaroncarson: don’t mess with .git
jessica: that's right!
aaroncarson: back out until you are in OpenDoor
eli_gas: im passing out guys
aaroncarson: lil
aaroncarson: lol
aaroncarson: ok, hey thanks for your time eli.
jessica: k, in just OpenDoor
aaroncarson: this is more than i expected, we’re just trying stuff out
eli_gas: aaron, you gotta get the log cause your the only one who didnt log out during the session 
aaroncarson: don’t worry, I have it
aaroncarson: Jess: type this
eli_gas: k, gn guys
aaroncarson: gedit README.md
jessica: gedit?
EthanEiter: later
eli_gas left the chat room. (Remote host closed the connection)
EthanEiter: ya
EthanEiter: gedit's a linux prog
jessica: edit the markdown, or just something in the file?
aaroncarson: Ethan, what is your branch again
aaroncarson: just add some text at the end, or something
aaroncarson: like, start a new paragraph that says “Jess wuz here”
aaroncarson: then save
aaroncarson: and close gedit
jessica: close the window, or do something in the terminal?
jessica: done... i think
aaroncarson: ok.
aaroncarson: jess, type: “git add .”
jessica: nothing specified, nothing added
jessica: oops! I got it
jessica: next?
aaroncarson: ok
aaroncarson: sorry, I was afk
jessica: no worries
aaroncarson: umm, then you do commit -a -m “Type a description of what you did here"
aaroncarson: sorry
aaroncarson: git commit -a -m “message"
jessica: I got it the second time, I forgot "." the first
aaroncarson: sweet
aaroncarson: so git commit worked?
jessica: I guess...
aaroncarson: ok, so do you understand what each command did? i can try to explain, it is helpful to know
jessica: I can't cd to read me... there must be an open command?
jessica: gedit
jessica: ?
aaroncarson: yes
aaroncarson: cd is change directory
aaroncarson: it won’t work on a file
jessica: k, it's saved on my local machine. I can only assume it was committed
aaroncarson: so when you ran the git commit command, did it give you feedback that it did stuff
jessica: no
jessica: just a new command line
jessica: but not a warning I got the time before
aaroncarson: when I run git commit -a -m “something”
jessica: ?
aaroncarson: I get the output that says
aaroncarson: [master cf64615] minor update to README.md
aaroncarson:  1 file changed, 4 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)
jessica: I did git add .
aaroncarson: ok
aaroncarson: so please run:
aaroncarson: git commit -a -m “text"
EthanEiter: imma git
EthanEiter:
aaroncarson: Ethan, the git jokes just won’t stop, will they?
aaroncarson: Git ‘er done ...
EthanEiter: no... probly not 
EthanEiter: later guyz
EthanEiter: GL
jessica: please tell me who you are... ugh. it's looking for my email address
EthanEiter: ya
EthanEiter: you need email address and a name
EthanEiter: latahz guyz
EthanEiter left the chat room. (Remote host closed the connection)
aaroncarson: ok
aaroncarson: so, jess, you can type these commands:
jessica: yep, working on it
aaroncarson: I have them, unless you found it elsewhere
aaroncarson: git config —global user.email <your email>
jessica: it was part of the message
aaroncarson: oh, ok
aaroncarson: I forgot about that, lol
jessica: I didn't get confirmation though
aaroncarson: when you run the email/username commands?
jessica: okay. it worked and I got confirmation on the file change
aaroncarson: cool
jessica: yeah
aaroncarson: please type: git branch
aaroncarson: which branch are you on?
aaroncarson: (one will be starred)
jessica: master
aaroncarson: ok
aaroncarson: I thought so
jessica: it's the only one I have
aaroncarson: time to make a new branch
aaroncarson: type: git branch JessBranch
aaroncarson: ro soemthing like that
aaroncarson: or something like that
aaroncarson: that makes a new branch
aaroncarson: then, if you type: git checkout JessBranch
jessica: done
aaroncarson: it will check out the new branch
aaroncarson: so if you type: git branch
aaroncarson: you will see you have changed
aaroncarson: then, please edit the file again.
jessica: it gave me confirmation
aaroncarson: Seems silly, but the branching parts are helpful
aaroncarson: That is good
aaroncarson: but I wanted the edit in a branch, so I can try to do a merge thing on the website eventually
aaroncarson: so jsut make another edit now
jessica: done
aaroncarson: ok, then do the add and commit commands again
jessica: oops. forgot the add before the commit
aaroncarson: thats ok
aaroncarson: I forgot that -a does the add
aaroncarson: sometimes
jessica: k
aaroncarson: so did it give you the confirmation
jessica: yep
aaroncarson: ok, we’r egetting close
aaroncarson: what is the name of your branch
jessica: JessBranch
aaroncarson: ok, try this command (one sec)
aaroncarson: git push origin master
jessica: it's asking for a user name. mine or yours?
aaroncarson: yours that you signed up for github with
jessica: done
aaroncarson: did it seem to work?  I’ll check the site … I’m trying to figure out how to get your updates
jessica: yep long confirmation message
aaroncarson: ok, cool, I see your changes
jessica: yay!
aaroncarson: So this is clunky, and I’ll try to understand more of what is happening, but at least I saw stuff.
aaroncarson: I think you somehow committed your custom branch into the master branch of the site.
aaroncarson: Not sure how
aaroncarson: but oh well
jessica: I'm not sure how either...
jessica: is it the -m?
aaroncarson: -m lets you pass a string as the label, instead of using vim
aaroncarson: don’t use vim, it sucks
jessica: I did push origin master... Ethan did merge eariler
aaroncarson: You do the merge to merge your local branch with your master branch
aaroncarson: that is ok if you use git only locally, but ideally master is what the remote repository looks like
aaroncarson: every time you make a change you want to upload to the server, you should start a new branch
aaroncarson: and edit there
jessica: no I never had a merge command
jessica: oh, I see what you're saying
aaroncarson: so, you can do the merge if you want, or just delete the extra branch with git branch -d JessBranch
aaroncarson: then you can get the updated version on github somehow ...
aaroncarson: oh, I know how
aaroncarson: if you didn’t delete your branch, do: git merge JessBranch
jessica: so it would be good to delete it now, so that it doesn't interfere with anything later, right?
aaroncarson: stop a sec
aaroncarson: try the merge command I posted
aaroncarson: sry
jessica: k
aaroncarson: this is wierd
aaroncarson: chatting and all
jessica: says it's already up todate
aaroncarson: ok, so do: git checkout master
aaroncarson: then run update
jessica: but both show up with git branch
aaroncarson: sorry,
aaroncarson: not update
aaroncarson: swith to master with git checkout master
aaroncarson: then do the merge
jessica: how do I swich?
aaroncarson: git checkout master
aaroncarson: that switches your branch
aaroncarson: it actually changes what files you will see with ls
aaroncarson: etc
jessica: got it
aaroncarson: so after switching, do the merge
jessica: git merge master?
aaroncarson: no
aaroncarson: git merge JessBranch
aaroncarson: I think
aaroncarson: if that doesn’t work, try the other one
jessica: k, updating confirmation message
aaroncarson: did that work
jessica: yep
aaroncarson: ok, so now delete your branch
aaroncarson: with: git branch -d JessBranch
jessica: done
aaroncarson: ok, almost done
aaroncarson: lastly, do: git pull
aaroncarson: that will grab the latest version from the server
jessica: um... okay...
aaroncarson: It should say something was updated, I changed the file
aaroncarson: a file just cuz
aaroncarson: you don’t have to do that
aaroncarson: unless you want to make sure you’re up to date
aaroncarson: I just want to know if it works for you
jessica: wish I could send you a screen shot
aaroncarson: no good
aaroncarson: put it in an email
aaroncarson: if you need to know how, you can read this http://community.linuxmint.com/software/view/shutter
aaroncarson: Mint should have shutter, a screenshot application, in your start menu
jessica: got it. Print scrn works well in Mint 
aaroncarson: Thats good
jessica: the message in my terminal?
aaroncarson: ok i see it
aaroncarson: you have opened vim.
aaroncarson: vim is annoying, but we can fix it
jessica: I'm having flash backs to 1983
aaroncarson: pretty much
aaroncarson: can you use the arrow keys to move a cursor around?
jessica: yes
aaroncarson: press escape
aaroncarson: then :
jessica: nothing
aaroncarson: try :q
jessica: The bottom says ^X for exit?
aaroncarson: esc + : + q + enter
aaroncarson: try that.  ^ is command
aaroncarson: sorry, control
aaroncarson: or alt, I can’t remember
aaroncarson: OH you were in NANO
aaroncarson: not VIM
jessica: save modified buffer (answering no will destroy changes)
aaroncarson: yes
aaroncarson: type yes
aaroncarson: well, either I guess
aaroncarson: any luck
jessica: UGH>>>>>>>>
jessica: File Name to Write: /home/jessica/code/OpenDoor/.git/MERGE_MSG                 
jessica: ^G Get Help        M-D DOS Format      M-A Append          M-B Backup File
jessica: ^C Cancel          M-M Mac Format      M-P Prepend
aaroncarson: try control + c
aaroncarson: or, just close the terminal
jessica: k
aaroncarson: Sometimes, I can’t figure it out either
aaroncarson: the tools are so strange
jessica: um, k, back to a regular terminal
jessica: back into opendoor
aaroncarson: so, do you know what command gave you that mess
jessica: pull something
aaroncarson: really?  Wierd
jessica: git pull
aaroncarson: instead of that,
jessica: yep
aaroncarson: lets try another similar one ...
aaroncarson: git pull origin master
aaroncarson: hmm, actually I dont think that will work
jessica: form OpenDoor, or should I be somewhere else?
aaroncarson: sorry
aaroncarson: git pull origin
aaroncarson: that worked fo rme
aaroncarson: for me
jessica: from OpenDoor or master?
aaroncarson: i don’t understand your question, is it prompting you?
jessica: no, what directory?
aaroncarson: oh
jessica: I cd'd back to OpenDoor, am I far enough in?
aaroncarson: yes, just go to OpenDoor
aaroncarson: then do git pull origin
jessica: error local changes to README would be overwritten by merge
jessica: please commit changes or stash them before merge
jessica: aborting.
aaroncarson: lol
aaroncarson: I don’t know
aaroncarson: run: git commit -a -m “”
jessica: oops for got "" that was a long message!
jessica: k, done
jessica: Merge branch master????
aaroncarson: umm, sure, if you need to
jessica: [master 13ed2e6] Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/aaroncarsonart/OpenDoor
jessica:  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
aaroncarson: I think you only have one branch though.  Didn’t we delete your other branch?
aaroncarson: if you do: git branch
aaroncarson: how many
jessica: yeah. it kind of looks like a confirmation message
jessica: just *master
aaroncarson: good
aaroncarson: try: git pull origin master
jessica: damn it!
jessica: Back to the bad screen
aaroncarson: ok, close the term and go back to opendoor
aaroncarson: not sure why it’s doing that ...
aaroncarson: I did git on my 2nd computer and am running commands like you all have been,
jessica: It tells me I need to write a message, but I don't see a way out of the page
aaroncarson: I know, it shouldn’t do that
aaroncarson: one more idea: we can check the server with: git remote -v
aaroncarson: what does it say
jessica: DOS format
jessica: hahahah!
aaroncarson: what?
aaroncarson: lol, i think something is not right
jessica: oh! Hit enter in the right magical space??
jessica: Looks like whatever I did worked
aaroncarson: ok.  did it say …
aaroncarson: remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
aaroncarson: remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
aaroncarson: remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
aaroncarson: Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
aaroncarson: From https://github.com/aaroncarsonart/OpenDoor
aaroncarson:   7118b5d..9db855b  master    -> origin/master
aaroncarson: Updating 7118b5d..9db855b
aaroncarson: Fast-forward
aaroncarson:  README.md | 1 +
aaroncarson:  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
aaroncarson: or such
jessica: no
aaroncarson: are you typing pull, or push
aaroncarson: because it sounds like a push
aaroncarson: but it should be a pull
jessica: jessica@jessica-Yoga ~/code/OpenDoor $ git pull origin master
jessica: From https://github.com/aaroncarsonart/OpenDoor
jessica:  * branch            master    -> FETCH_HEAD
jessica: Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
aaroncarson: wierd
aaroncarson: just because, try: get pull origin
jessica: I have no idea
aaroncarson: If you need to get going, I understand, I’m not trying to keep you.  I’m gonna be up for a while on homework
aaroncarson: I’m not trying to boss you around, just trying to figure this stuff out
jessica: "Already  up to date"
jessica: No worries
aaroncarson: well, apparently it worked.
jessica: I think so
aaroncarson: I think this is probably enough work for one night.  I hope you’re benefiting from this, I think I’m learning more about how this whole system worked.
jessica: the message before said merge made by the recursive strategy
jessica: yes, this is good!
aaroncarson: I know, I was wondering about that
aaroncarson: I didn’t get that part
aaroncarson: there’s a bunch of varieties of git pull
aaroncarson: git pull
jessica: Especially after my kids quit having melt downs with phones, lol
aaroncarson: git pull -U
aaroncarson: get pull origin
aaroncarson: git pull master
aaroncarson: sorry
aaroncarson: git pull origin master
aaroncarson: I think the “master” can be replaced with a different branch too, if one exists
jessica: it happens, usually at the worst time 
aaroncarson: something to try to figure out later
aaroncarson: yeah, I remember you saying that
aaroncarson: I don’t know anything about Iphones
jessica: now she's busy reloading all her apps, lol
aaroncarson: So, when you uploaded the chat log, did you remove the timestamps?
aaroncarson: I will upload this one, just thinking about my strategy
jessica: I can copy and it excludes the time stamps
jessica: Oh, the last one? Yes
aaroncarson: Really?  I wish I could do that
jessica: it was a pain, that one was on windows.
jessica: The chat on Mint when I copy and paste it excludes the time stamps
aaroncarson: oh hey, I can hide the timestamp!
aaroncarson: cool
jessica: I could make a google doc and copy and paste what I have to save you some work
jessica: nice! Did that work?
aaroncarson: yes, nice and simple
aaroncarson: Alright, I got the log
jessica: Cool
